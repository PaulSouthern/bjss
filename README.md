# BJSS

This repository contains the Technical Test specs and page objects.

<br />

### Improvements

Spec 1 

- Implement helper class to add new item to cart
- Store Product Code to use to locate the element on the checkout page
- Issues with screen resolution meant I was unable to select Quick View.  Method included but commented out.
- Add dependencies to spec helper file to avoid calling in spec.  Benefits readability, however will also include all objects in all specs.
